# Disclosure Glossary

## Disclosure Timeframe
- **Backward-looking**: Past-only; the risk/event was started and completed in the past with no signal it continues or affects the company now.
- **Present day**: Ongoing at report time; may have started earlier but explicitly stated as currently relevant or persisting into the near term.
- **Forward-looking**: Not yet manifested; discusses anticipated or potential future events/impacts (probable or hypothetical) with no evidence it has begun.
- **Multiple or Unclear**: Ambiguous or spans more than one horizon; wording does not clearly indicate past, present, or future.

## Financial Disclosure Type
- **Financial**: Explicit, quantified financial values tied directly to the risk (fines, penalties, restoration, settlements, etc.).
- **Partial-type**: Acknowledges financial impact/materiality without exact amounts (confidential, uncertain, pending, or withheld).
- **Non-Financial**: No explicit financial amounts or asserted financial materiality; purely qualitative/descriptive.

## Disclosure Framing
- **Risk**: Emphasizes harm/uncertainty/negative consequences and the need to mitigate/control.
- **Opportunity**: Frames as beneficial/value-creating (growth, innovation, efficiency, advantage).
- **Neutral**: Factual/descriptive without clear negative/positive framing.
