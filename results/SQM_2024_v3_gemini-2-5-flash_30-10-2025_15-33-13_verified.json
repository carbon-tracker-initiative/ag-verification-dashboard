Pessimistic Scenario - Current Policies: No carbon price is projected, implying that current policies will not drive meaningful carbon regulation in this scenario. Mitigation measures: As this risk could begin to impact in 2027, the first thing we did was to implement a methodology to quantify the CBAM footprint for the transitional reporting period between 2023 and 2025.

It explicitly identifies 'Exposure to litigation and/or penalties due to legal non-compliance' as a 'Legal Risk.' While it states that 'No breach of regulations or voluntary codes has been identified with regard to the impacts of products and services on health and safety,' it also acknowledges not having a 'hazardous substance management procedure focused on generating alternatives that impact humans or the environment less,' which could be a vulnerability to future claims. Most notably, the company provides concrete financial figures for fines (Ch$ 14,710,840 and US$ 173) and discloses '12 labor protection actions' filed in 2024, with eight still pending, demonstrating its exposure to legal challenges and associated financial impacts, even if these are not directly product-related health/environmental claims."
