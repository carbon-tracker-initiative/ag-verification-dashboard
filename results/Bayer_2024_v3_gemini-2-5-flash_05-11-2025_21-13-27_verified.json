Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto’s herbicides, including Roundup™-branded products. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma, and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiffs are claiming, inter alia, that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri. ... As of December 31, 2024, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled US$5.9 billion (€5.7 billion). Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with the products mentioned above. As of January 31, 2025, a total of 29 Canadian lawsuits (class actions and individual actions) relating to Roundup™ are pending against Bayer. The lead class action was partially certified and will proceed on the merits. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the safety of glyphosate and our glyphosate-based formulations vigorously.",

PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for various purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979. In 2020, Bayer entered into a class settlement, valued at approximately US$650 million, to settle claims of approximately 2,500 municipal entities. In 2022, the court issued its final approval of the class settlement. There were approximately 84 opt-outs of the class settlement, the majority of which have now filed lawsuits. In July 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of liability, to pay US$160 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Seattle, US$35 million of which was devoted to PCB remediation. In September 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of liability, to pay US$35 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Los Angeles. Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington, Washington D.C., New Mexico, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately US$456 million. The Company also settled a pending matter with the State of Oregon for US$698 million, reflecting unique circumstances in that State. ... Monsanto also faces numerous lawsuits claiming personal injury due to use of and exposure to PCB products in school buildings. ... The other 49 plaintiffs were awarded a total of approximately US$320 million in compensatory and a multiple thereof in punitive damages.",

The company acknowledges 'ongoing litigation' impacting its share price, and details numerous past and pending lawsuits. For glyphosate, it reports a provision of US$5.9 billion (€5.7 billion) as of December 31, 2024. For PCBs, it details multiple class settlements and individual lawsuit awards, including a US$650 million class settlement, US$160 million for Seattle, US$35 million for Los Angeles, US$456 million for prior cases, US$698 million for Oregon, and US$320 million in compensatory damages for plaintiffs in SVEC cases. The company also discusses potential future financial disadvantages, including compensatory and punitive damages, and the need to cover increased financial requirements through debt, equity, or asset divestments. This demonstrates a comprehensive disclosure of the risk and its financial implications."
