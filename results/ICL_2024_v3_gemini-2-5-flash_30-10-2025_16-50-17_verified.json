      "summary": "The company frequently discusses 'soil health' as an area its products aim to improve or as a general sustainability challenge. It highlights innovations like biodegradable controlled-release fertilizers (eqo.x) that address concerns such as microplastic accumulation in soils and nutrient loss. However, the report does not explicitly disclose that 'soil degradation caused by its fertilizer products' (specifically worsening soil structure, reducing water infiltration/retention, or increasing erosion) is considered a direct risk to the business. The disclosures consistently frame their products and R&D as solutions to environmental challenges, rather than acknowledging their products as a source of the specific soil degradation risks mentioned in the question."

Another class action for environmental damage from wastewater at the Zin site resulted in a procedural arrangement and a payment of 'approximately 3 million NIS.' A third instance involved several class action claims settled in December 2022 following an environmental incident at Ashalim Creek. These disclosures, including specific financial amounts and references to financial statements, clearly demonstrate that such legal challenges are a material business risk."
