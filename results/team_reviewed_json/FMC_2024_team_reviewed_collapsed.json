This represents a 75% reduction from 2023 and is our strongest process safety record to date. We also enhanced FMC’s quality review and learning review protocols in 2024. The new quality review protocol strengthens process hazard analysis (PHA) by adding a critical layer of expert validation. Before a report is finalized, an expert conducts a review—validating findings, challenging assumptions, and uncovering opportunities for quality improvements. These reviews have led to improvements in PHA education, technical guidance, and execution standards, supporting a stronger, more consistent approach to hazard analysis. FMC’s new learning review protocol is aimed at driving understanding of root causes and standardizing corrective actions across all applicable sites to prevent incident recurrence. For example, we put the new learning program into action when a flexible connection failure between mechanical conveyors led to the release of hazardous powder.",

We are sensitive to regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. Moreover, we are required to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements of biological products. Protocols and regulations may change, or regulatory agencies may determine that a biological product is not approvable. There is a risk that future regulatory requirements may lead to delays in development of biologicals or limit growth from biologicals. Many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. In the European Union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals), which requires manufacturers to verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely. Changes to the regulatory environment may be influenced by non-government public pressure as a result of negative perception regarding the use of our crop protection products. Products reviewed by regulators and labeled safe for use may still be challenged by others which could lead to negative public perception or regulatory action. Competing products labeled safe for use were subject to lawsuits or claims, and a similar situation for our products could result in negative impacts.",
