The other 49 plaintiffs were awarded a total of approximately US$320 million in compensatory and a multiple thereof in punitive damages. ... In 2023, a putative class action lawsuit (Neddo) was filed in the District of Vermont by a mother on behalf of her three children who attended a local school. She alleges they are at increased risk of cancer from PCB exposure and seeks the cost of medical monitoring. ... We may incur considerable financial disadvantages from pending lawsuits and/or potential future cases if, for example, we are ordered to pay compensatory and possibly punitive damages or if we assume payment obligations under out-of-court settlements.",

These laws would give farmers and manufacturers more legal certainty regarding labeling.

Without reforms, the United States runs the risk of losing a domestically manufactured crop protection tool that has time and again been classified as safe by regulatory authorities all over the world.

PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for various purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979.

In July 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of liability, to pay US$160 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Seattle, US$35 million of which was devoted to PCB remediation. In September 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of liability, to pay US$35 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Los Angeles. Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington, Washington D.C., New Mexico, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately US$456 million.

We are making progress, and we are confident that this progress will also be reflected in our financial outcomes in the future. ... We are expecting major developments on the litigation front in 2025. In the glyphosate litigation, we will file a petition for review with the US Supreme Court, as we’ve announced previously. We have also made considerable progress in our talks with policymakers at the federal and state level, and legislation has been introduced in Congress and numerous states. These laws would give farmers and manufacturers more legal certainty regarding labeling. We are receiving a great deal of support from farming associations who are concerned about the availability of one essential product, glyphosate. Without reforms, the United States runs the risk of losing a domestically manufactured crop protection tool that has time and again been classified as safe by regulatory authorities all over the world. Last year, we received positive outcomes in six of the eight trials heard in a court of first instance, and are appealing the other verdicts.

In addition, our manufacturing plants in Alberta and Ontario are subject to provincial or federal laws that impose a price on excess GHG emissions. Each of these laws establishes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions standards applicable to our facilities in terms of emissions per unit of production, with the provincial laws and the federal law using different formulas for establishing the intensity-based limits and the reductions in these limits over time... If a facility’s CO2e emissions exceed the applicable limit, the excess emissions must be offset, either through obtaining qualifying emission credits or by making a payment for each ton of excess emissions. For calendar year 2025, the excess emissions fee under the federal, Alberta and Ontario regulatory programs is CAD $95 per metric ton, which fee will increase by CAD $15 per metric ton per year, reaching CAD $170 per metric ton by 2030.",

The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. In 2014, we and the current property owner entered into a Consent Order with IDEQ and the U.S. Forest Service to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site. The remedial investigation was submitted to the agencies in 2021. The next step will be a risk assessment, followed by a feasibility study, and then a decision on remediation at the site. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of the Interior and other trustees intended to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 18 former phosphate mines and three former processing facilities in southeast Idaho. The Georgetown Canyon former mine and processing facility was included in the group of former mines and processing facilities identified by the trustees. In June 2021, we received another notice from the U.S. Department of the Interior that the natural resource damage trustees were commencing a ‘subsequent’ phase of the natural resource damage assessment, but no further details were provided with respect to said assessment. Because the former Georgetown Canyon mine site is still in the risk assessment and feasibility study stage, we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability, if any, with respect to the cleanup of the site or a possible claim for natural resource damages. However, based on the results of the site investigation conducted to date, we do not expect the remedial or financial obligations to which we may be subject involving this or other cleanup sites will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",

The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. In 2014, we and the current property owner entered into a Consent Order with IDEQ and the U.S. Forest Service to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site. The remedial investigation was submitted to the agencies in 2021. The next step will be a risk assessment, followed by a feasibility study, and then a decision on remediation at the site. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice from the U.S. Department of the Interior and other trustees intended to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 18 former phosphate mines and three former processing facilities in southeast Idaho. The Georgetown Canyon former mine and processing facility was included in the group of former mines and processing facilities identified by the trustees. In June 2021, we received another notice from the U.S. Department of the Interior that the natural resource damage trustees were commencing a ‘subsequent’ phase of the natural resource damage assessment, but no further details were provided with respect to said assessment. Because the former Georgetown Canyon mine site is still in the risk assessment and feasibility study stage, we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability, if any, with respect to the cleanup of the site or a possible claim for natural resource damages. However, based on the results of the site investigation conducted to date, we do not expect the remedial or financial obligations to which we may be subject involving this or other cleanup sites will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",

The lawsuits allege that EIDP and others supplied materials used at these facilities resulting in PFOA air and water contamination. A court approved settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the other co-defendants regarding the Baker Class Action case.

At December 31, 2024, the company had accrued obligations of $478 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $46 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (\"PRPs\") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to approximately $600 million above the accrued obligations amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In April 2021, four municipalities in the Netherlands filed complaints alleging contamination of land and groundwater resulting from the emission of PFOA and GenX by Corteva, DuPont and Chemours. The municipalities seek to recover costs incurred due to the alleged emissions, including damages for investigation costs, construction project delays, depreciation of land, soil remediation, liabilities to contractors, and attorneys’ fees. In September 2023, the court entered a second interlocutory judgment, ruling, inter alia, that defendants were liable to the municipalities for PFOA emissions during a certain time period, and the removal costs of deposited emissions on the municipalities land infringes their property rights by an objective standard. In June 2024, Chemours and these Dutch municipalities signed a letter of intent that included the implementation of a specific remediation plan for the restoration of restricted vegetable gardens in certain areas of those municipalities to be funded by Chemours, sampling and developing a program to address a recreational lake, and further settlement discussions, including a potential fund to cover certain other expenditures aimed at environmental-related activities. While the letter of intent contemplates the possibility of settlement, discussions between the parties related to the resolution to these matters remain ongoing. Although the company believes a loss is probable, it is not estimable at this time due to various reasons including, among others, that such discussions remain in their early stages. As of December 31, 2024, an accrual has been established for the estimated environmental remediation set forth in the letter of intent.",

As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (\"PRPs\") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately $600 million above the accrued obligations amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.",

It is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings and any potential impact on Corteva. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters may result in losses not fully covered by Corteva's insurance policies, and could be material to Corteva's financial results.

The municipalities seek to recover costs incurred due to the alleged emissions, including damages for investigation costs, construction project delays, depreciation of land, soil remediation, liabilities to contractors, and attorneys’ fees. In September 2023, the court entered a second interlocutory judgment, ruling, inter alia, that defendants were liable to the municipalities for PFOA emissions during a certain time period, and the removal costs of deposited emissions on the municipalities land infringes their property rights by an objective standard. In June 2024, Chemours and these Dutch municipalities signed a letter of intent that included the implementation of a specific remediation plan for the restoration of restricted vegetable gardens in certain areas of those municipalities to be funded by Chemours, sampling and developing a program to address a recreational lake, and further settlement discussions, including a potential fund to cover certain other expenditures aimed at environmental-related activities. While the letter of intent contemplates the possibility of settlement, discussions between the parties related to the resolution to these matters remain ongoing. Although the company believes a loss is probable, it is not estimable at this time due to various reasons including, among others, that such discussions remain in their early stages. As of December 31, 2024, an accrual has been established for the estimated environmental remediation set forth in the letter of intent. Additionally, the Office of Public Prosecutor in the Netherlands opened a criminal investigation against certain Dutch subsidiaries of Chemours and Historical DuPont, as well as each subsidiary's directors, alleging unlawful PFOA and GenX emissions from Chemours' Dordrecht Works facility.",

At December 31, 2024, the company had accrued obligations of $478 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $46 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (\"PRPs\") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately $600 million above the accrued obligations amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.",

This represents a 75% reduction from 2023 and is our strongest process safety record to date. We also enhanced FMC’s quality review and learning review protocols in 2024. The new quality review protocol strengthens process hazard analysis (PHA) by adding a critical layer of expert validation. Before a report is finalized, an expert conducts a review—validating findings, challenging assumptions, and uncovering opportunities for quality improvements. These reviews have led to improvements in PHA education, technical guidance, and execution standards, supporting a stronger, more consistent approach to hazard analysis. FMC’s new learning review protocol is aimed at driving understanding of root causes and standardizing corrective actions across all applicable sites to prevent incident recurrence. For example, we put the new learning program into action when a flexible connection failure between mechanical conveyors led to the release of hazardous powder.",

We are sensitive to regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. Moreover, we are required to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements of biological products. Protocols and regulations may change, or regulatory agencies may determine that a biological product is not approvable. There is a risk that future regulatory requirements may lead to delays in development of biologicals or limit growth from biologicals. Many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. In the European Union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals), which requires manufacturers to verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely. Changes to the regulatory environment may be influenced by non-government public pressure as a result of negative perception regarding the use of our crop protection products. Products reviewed by regulators and labeled safe for use may still be challenged by others which could lead to negative public perception or regulatory action. Competing products labeled safe for use were subject to lawsuits or claims, and a similar situation for our products could result in negative impacts.",

At the beginning of April 2025, the prices in the European market were at their lowest level in 12 months, reaching EUR 60/tonne, compared to EUR 78/tonne at the start of February this year. The reason for the price drop is the decline in the oil and natural gas markets, linked to the CO2 market. This may also be attributed to the anticipated lower demand for emission allowances in view of the deteriorating global economic outlook driven by the US tariffs, signals of shifting climate policy directions in Europe following the change in the US administration and, among other factors, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The Group companies proactively manage their purchases of CO2 emission allowances. Due to significant cyclical changes with resulting revisions to the companies’ production plans, including CO2 emissions, there is a strong need to adjust the volume of allowances to redeem the CO2 emissions for 2024. The companies are also selling their existing allowances repurchasing predefined volumes to secure additional financing for day-to-day operations. According to Refinitiv’s forecasts of 23 January 2025, the average price of CO₂ emission allowances is expected to be EUR 73.5 in 2025, down from EUR 76.9 in the previous forecast. Prices are projected to rise to EUR 91.9 in 2026 and exceed EUR 103 from 2027 onward. The emission allowance market remains a regulated market and the regulator’s intention is to achieve a sustainable increase in EUA prices in line with the growing climate ambitions of the Fit for 55 package. However, the economic downturn in 2025 in the euro area and the effects of high energy prices should stabilise the EUA prices in the medium term due to a decline in industrial demand. Transitory price declines may be brought about by the REPowerEU plan for energy savings, diversification of energy supplies, and accelerated roll-out of renewable energy, as well as lower production of electricity from coal. The ETS market may consolidate in the price range of EUR 70-95.",

The new US tariffs announced on 2 April (suspended for 90 days, with the exception of China) are unlikely to cause major disruptions on the LNG market as global demand for LNG has become more inflexible over the past three years. The key buyers of US LNG, such as the EU, Japan, and South Korea, may consider retaliatory duties in response to the new US trade policy; however, it is unlikely that LNG will be included.

ICL is careful to ensure that the chemical substances it produces and sells are handled in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations throughout their life cycle. ICL prepares documentation containing information about products and provides proper guidance to its employees, contractors, customers and the public on the safe use of its chemicals and products. ICL implements the European regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) at all its operations and registers its chemicals as required by law. ICL has submitted registration applications for all the chemicals relevant for its businesses in the EU (production and sale). Several substances are under evaluation by the authorities (European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and Member State regulators), some of which have been listed as Substances of Very High Concern. ICL has volunteered to lead and prepare joint dossiers for dozens of substances (acting as a Lead Registrant). ICL utilizes data from toxicology, environmental fate, environmental toxicity studies and other relevant sources to classify chemicals and products according to the UN Global Harmonization System (GHS), a globally adopted classification and labeling system. All of ICL’s relevant chemicals are classified in line with respective classification and labeling regulations. All (100%) of ICL products undergo hazard assessments and regulatory screening. ICL performs detailed identification of all products and their constituents. As part of our Safety Data Sheets (SDS) procedure as well as the SDS creation process, the entire composition of a product is identified, reviewed, and assessed for hazards. This periodic assessment applies to all existing as well as new products and those under development. ICL monitors all regulatory requirements in regard to respective chemical laws globally to comply in all countries in which ICL operates (in addition to REACH), such as TSCA regulations and requirements in the US or specific registration requirements in South Korea. ICL provides its customers with SDS’ for all relevant products which are available in dozens of languages and beyond compliance requirements for most countries. Moreover, we provide tailored safety training and resources to our employees and other stakeholders who are logistics personnel and distributors, emphasizing the critical importance of safe handling practices for hazardous substances. The SDS lists regulatory information about each product and is periodically updated to remain in compliance with regulatory developments. In addition, product-specific regulatory information about registration/notification status is communicated to our relevant business segments and to our customers on a regular basis and upon request.In addition to REACH and the various chemical- specific limitations, the European Commission has introduced the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS). CSS was launched in October 2020 to provide a new long-term strategy for chemical-related policies, in line with the aims of the EU Green Deal. We are carefully monitoring developments related to CSS to prepare for upcoming regulatory requirements which may affect many of our products. We disclose all regulatory registrations and uses of our substances with the recognition that some uses by our customers may not always be fully known to us. This includes both product and chemical registrations, with uses defined either by us or our clients, and publicly available as required for example by REACH and biocidal registrations under BPR.",

It draws upon comprehensive physical, chemical, toxicological, and environmental data generated by ICL’s scientific group. Quantitative values like Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) or Derived No-Effect Levels (DNELs) are established based on toxicological insights, aiming to prevent overexposure to hazardous chemicals for both employees and the public. These values have been established to prevent employees and the general public from overexposure to hazardous chemicals. Specifically, regulations of food additives are based on positive lists of proven safe substances. If a substance is not provided for, it cannot be used in food. Adherence to food regulations involves rigorous scrutiny, ensuring that substances meet positive lists of proven safe materials. ICL has responded to evolving regulations, such as the 2019 prohibition of aluminum-based additives in certain food categories. Consequently, we have reviewed product specifications, modifying indications for use to align with regulatory standards. Furthermore, ongoing studies are conducted to identify and mitigate risks associated with substances, demonstrating our commitment to regulatory compliance and proactive risk management. This includes discontinuation of certain products or restricting their use to specific applications. For example, DECA has been discontinued, and methyl bromide is produced on a limited scale, solely for container disinfection rather than as a soil treatment. As methyl bromide (used for soil fumigation) has been included in the list of controlled substances, ICL has significantly reduced its production (for soil fumigation applications) and has shut down one of its production facilities.",

Due to increasing global awareness of animal welfare, the use of animals has been limited, at least for purposes of product development and licensing. As a result, methods are constantly being developed around the world, including the use of computerized models for prediction, as well as experimental models in tissue cultures. Some of these models are even accepted by authorities as substitutes for studies on animals. Over the years, ICL has worked to identify the most reliable and appropriate models that can provide data on the properties of substances under development. These models have replaced some animal testing, at least in the initial stages of product development. To date, we have succeeded in identifying alternative methods relating to several properties, such as the immediate toxicity of substances and skin and eye irritations.

In 2024, approximately 4 million tonnes of phosphogypsum were utilized under this project. This project not only restores historical mining areas but also provides an effective solution for phosphogypsum disposal. By repurposing this industrial by-product, it reduces land use for long-term storage, mitigates risks of soil and water pollution, and improves the surrounding ecological environment.

As of April 1, 2024 a carbon tax of $80 per tonne now applies in Canada for any emitter not covered under the federal backstop program or approved provincial program. Our Saskatchewan Potash facilities are subject to the Saskatchewan climate change plan regarding emissions at our facilities; however, indirect costs from the carbon tax associated with electricity, natural gas consumption and transportation are currently passed through to Mosaic. More stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in Canada’s NDC.",

The strategy calls for, among other matters, reduction of the flow of excess nutrients into the Gulf of America through state nutrient reduction frameworks, new nutrient reduction approaches and reduction of agricultural and urban sources of excess nutrients. Implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level. Through these heightened actions by the states, some are also leveraging groundwater protection initiatives to mandate nutrient use restrictions for fall applications in specific agricultural regions to limit nutrient losses.

We have contingent environmental remedial liabilities that arise principally from three sources which are further discussed below: (i) facilities currently or formerly owned by our subsidiaries or their predecessors; (ii) facilities adjacent to currently or formerly owned facilities; and (iii) third-party Superfund or state equivalent sites where we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials. Taking into consideration established accruals for environmental remedial matters of approximately $197.5 million as of December 31, 2024, expenditures for these known conditions currently are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on our business or financial condition. However, material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at known sites or at other current or former sites.",

However, nitrogen fertilizer also generates GHG emissions when it is produced and after it is applied to the soil. Read more. Nutrien endeavors to cultivate agricultural solutions so farmers can increase food production for future generations. This will be accomplished while striving to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture and maintain existing arable land use. Our internal and external stakeholders have identified potential impacts from climate-related risks as a top sustainability concern, both from the physical risk of increased weather pattern variability and its impact on our operations and customers, and the transitional risk of the expectation to reduce emissions from fertilizer use, among other risks. At the same time, we have an opportunity to help farmers mitigate and adapt to the changing climate and increase our operational efficiency, while also striving to reduce the associated GHG emissions.

(“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",

This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",

Anticipated costs associated with these matters are added to accrued environmental costs in the manner described in Note 22. We have established provisions for environmental site assessment and/or remediation matters to the extent that we consider expenses associated with those matters likely to be incurred. Except for the uncertainties described below, we do not believe that our future obligations with respect to these matters are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Legal matters with significant uncertainties include the following: – The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“US EPA”) has an ongoing enforcement initiative directed at the phosphate industry related to the scope of an exemption for mineral processing wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",

The cases vary, but complaints in these cases generally seek unspecified monetary damages (actual, compensatory, consequential and punitive) from multiple defendants. The Company believes that the claims against it are without merit and is vigorously defending against them. The Company has not recorded any accruals in its consolidated financial statements as the likelihood of a loss from these cases is not probable at this time.

Laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways. All pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with FIFRA and most must be registered with the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies. Our inability to obtain or maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the product(s) involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid these risks. For example, there are indications that federal agencies in the U.S. may take more restrictive positions on pesticides. In addition, several provinces in Canada have adopted regulations that substantially restrict our ability to market and sell certain consumer pesticide products. Under the Food Quality Protection Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996, food-use pesticides are evaluated to determine whether there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effects of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the U.S. EPA is evaluating the cumulative and aggregate risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, certain of which may be also used on crops processed into various food products, are manufactured by independent third parties and continue to be evaluated by the U.S. EPA as part of this exposure risk assessment. The U.S. EPA or the third-party registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of these continuing evaluations. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, we cannot provide assurance that our products, particularly pesticide products, will not cause or be alleged to cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances, particularly when used improperly or contrary to instructions.

For example, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products or products we market on behalf of third parties may also result in a decline in sales for a particular product and could damage the reputation or the value of related brands, involve us in litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

A significant disruption in the availability or price of any of our key raw materials could negatively impact our business. Increases in the prices of key commodities and other raw materials could adversely affect our ability to manage our cost structure. Market conditions may limit our ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our raw material costs.

Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our proprietary technologies can limit our ability to locate or utilize alternative inputs for certain products. For certain inputs, new sources of supply may have to be qualified under regulatory standards, which can require additional investment and delay bringing a product to market.

Conservative scenario - Nationally Determined Contributions: Carbon prices are significantly lower, reaching only US$ 69/tCO2e in 2060, reflecting more moderate national commitments, similar to the current situation. Pessimistic Scenario - Current Policies: No carbon price is projected, implying that current policies will not drive meaningful carbon regulation in this scenario. Mitigation measures: As this risk could begin to impact in 2027, the first thing we did was to implement a methodology to quantify the CBAM footprint for the transitional reporting period between 2023 and 2025.

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requires us to declare the carbon footprint of our fertilizer products for tax purposes in the European Union in the coming years. In addition, Chilean green tax regulations impose a tax on stationary (fixed) sources such as boilers and/or turbines that, individually or as a whole, emit: • 100 or more metric tons per year of particulate matter (PM), • o 25,000 or more metric tons per year of carbon dioxide (CO2). The latter regulation requires us to pay a green tax on Coya Sur's nitrate produc-tion. To adapt to these changes, we have developed a methodology for measuring our carbon footprint more accurately and then implement technologies to reduce emissions. Complying with these regulations not only helps us avoid penalties, but also strengthens our competitiveness in the fertilizer industry.

Plaintiffs allege that their use or exposure to Syngenta’s paraquat products has caused them to develop Parkinson’s disease and/or kidney disease. The cases name Syngenta AG, Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC, and Syngenta Seeds, and variously named alleged distributors of paraquat as additional defendants. While the counts raised in each complaint differ slightly by plaintiff and jurisdiction, they tend to include: (1) Strict Liability - Design Defect; (2) Strict Liability - Failure to Warn; (3) Negligence; (4) Public Nuisance; (5) Violation of Consumer Fraud & Deceptive Business Practices Acts; (6) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability; and (7) Punitive Damages. Certain suits also include claims by the spouses of individuals with Parkinson’s disease for Loss of Consortium. The pending state court cases are in California, Delaware, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia. The pending federal court cases were filed in various U.S. District Courts, though the majority of new cases are being filed directly in the Southern District of Illinois as part of the pending Multi-District Litigation. On April 17, 2024, the MDL court granted Defendants’ Motion to Exclude the expert testimony of the sole expert on the critical issue of general causation that had been presented by the Plaintiffs in the four initial bellwether cases selected for trial. On the same date, the MDL court also granted Defendants’ Joint Motion for Summary Judgment dismissing those four cases due to the Plaintiffs’ inability to establish a causal link between occupational paraquat exposure and Parkinson’s disease without the proffered expert testimony. Plaintiffs have since filed a notice of appeal of these dismissals to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals; briefing was completed on October 16, 2024 and oral argument was held on February 12, 2025 and a decision is expected in the coming months. Syngenta will continue to defend all these lawsuits, the claims in which are without merit.",

Remediation of environmental damage at sites with which Syngenta is associated typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin. The assumptions used by Syngenta to estimate its environmental provisions may change significantly before or during the remediation period due to changes in the extent of remediation required or the method used to remediate the damage. In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available. The major uncertainties that impact the outcome of remediation are: the extent of the contaminated land area, which is not always limited to land occupied by the Syngenta site. Ongoing monitoring or remediation work may identify changes in the area believed to be contaminated; the nature of the work Syngenta will be obliged to perform or pay for. This depends upon the current or proposed use of contaminated land, substantively enacted legislation, and land zoning by and negotiation with the relevant regulatory authorities. In Switzerland, proposed remediation plans at certain sites may be subject to public referenda; sharing of costs with other past and present occupiers of Syngenta’s sites. At certain shared sites, Syngenta is responsible for an agreed proportion of remediation costs, which may change following discussions with authorities and the affected third parties. At other sites, third parties have agreed to reimburse Syngenta for some or all of the costs it incurs. Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating such long-term future obligations, Syngenta periodically supplements its internal expertise with external expertise when determining environmental provisions.",

Plaintiffs allege negligence through the sale by that manufacturer and by Syngenta of products containing such insecticides in the knowledge that they would be injurious to bees and by virtue of misrepresentations and concealment relating thereto. Plaintiffs claim 400 million Canadian dollars (USD 278 million at December 31, 2024, exchange rates) general and 50 million Canadian dollars (USD 35 million at December 31, 2024, exchange rates) punitive damages. The pleadings in the Ontario proceedings were subsequently amended by plaintiffs’ counsel to add waiver of tort and unlawful conspiracy to the single cause of action, negligence, which was previously pleaded. Both of the additional causes of action are ancillary to and largely dependent on the negligence claim. The class has not yet been authorized. In October 2014, a Motion for Authorization was filed by the same firm of plaintiffs’ counsel in Montréal, Quebec seeking permission to bring a similar class proceeding in that province. The proposed representative plaintiff operates a family business specialized in the breeding of queen bees. The Quebec litigation closely resembles the original Ontario lawsuit claiming negligence except that, rather than a nationwide class, it alleges a class limited to Quebec. At this early stage damages are unspecified. The Motion for Authorization was argued in November 2017. The Quebec class has been authorized on August 20, 2018, and notices have been sent to potential class members. Plaintiffs’ motion to add Syngenta AG as a defendant has been granted.

Additionally, frequent safety audits were conducted to ensure the correct use of lifting equipment, the quality and proper use of personal protective equipment, and the good condition of tools. Internal transport remains a known risk in the foundry. In 2024, measures were taken to ensure safe pedestrian passage within the foundry. Where feasible, pedestrians were completely separated from forklift trucks, and risky intersections were more clearly marked using gobo light projections. The foundry also uses hazardous substances like isocyanates. Specific training was provided to operators on the safe handling of these substances.",

The increase of the provisions for environmental obligations can be explained by the increase of the estimated cash outflows for the remediation of historical soil and groundwater contamination in Belgium and France. The increase of the estimated cash outflows is mainly due to the increase of the estimated volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater to be treated and the increase of the estimated costs for the treatment of the contaminated soil and groundwater. The group believes that the estimates are reasonable and consistent with the internal reporting and reflect management’s best estimates. However, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Yara’s scope 1 emissions are 69 percent covered by regulated emission schemes.
