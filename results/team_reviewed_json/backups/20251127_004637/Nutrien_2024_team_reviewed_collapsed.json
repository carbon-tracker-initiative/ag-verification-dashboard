However, nitrogen fertilizer also generates GHG emissions when it is produced and after it is applied to the soil. Read more. Nutrien endeavors to cultivate agricultural solutions so farmers can increase food production for future generations. This will be accomplished while striving to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture and maintain existing arable land use. Our internal and external stakeholders have identified potential impacts from climate-related risks as a top sustainability concern, both from the physical risk of increased weather pattern variability and its impact on our operations and customers, and the transitional risk of the expectation to reduce emissions from fertilizer use, among other risks. At the same time, we have an opportunity to help farmers mitigate and adapt to the changing climate and increase our operational efficiency, while also striving to reduce the associated GHG emissions. Our operations, facilities and fleet are associated with Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our value chain generates our Scope 3 GHG emissions.",

This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",
