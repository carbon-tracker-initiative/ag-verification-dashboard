PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for various purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979. In 2020, Bayer entered into a class settlement, valued at approximately US$650 million, to settle claims of approximately 2,500 municipal entities. In 2022, the court issued its final approval of the class settlement. There were approximately 84 opt-outs of the class settlement, the majority of which have now filed lawsuits. In July 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of liability, to pay US$160 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Seattle, US$35 million of which was devoted to PCB remediation. In September 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of liability, to pay US$35 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Los Angeles. Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington, Washington D.C., New Mexico, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately US$456 million.

Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto’s herbicides, including Roundup™-branded products. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma, and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiffs are claiming, inter alia, that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri. ... As of December 31, 2024, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled US$5.9 billion (€5.7 billion). Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with the products mentioned above. As of January 31, 2025, a total of 29 Canadian lawsuits (class actions and individual actions) relating to Roundup™ are pending against Bayer. The lead class action was partially certified and will proceed on the merits. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the safety of glyphosate and our glyphosate-based formulations vigorously.",

We are totally committed to unleashing the full potential of our company. That’s why we are strenuously working on the strategic priorities that we defined last year. We are making progress, and we are confident that this progress will also be reflected in our financial outcomes in the future. ... We are expecting major developments on the litigation front in 2025. In the glyphosate litigation, we will file a petition for review with the US Supreme Court, as we’ve announced previously. We have also made considerable progress in our talks with policymakers at the federal and state level, and legislation has been introduced in Congress and numerous states. These laws would give farmers and manufacturers more legal certainty regarding labeling. We are receiving a great deal of support from farming associations who are concerned about the availability of one essential product, glyphosate. Without reforms, the United States runs the risk of losing a domestically manufactured crop protection tool that has time and again been classified as safe by regulatory authorities all over the world. Last year, we received positive outcomes in six of the eight trials heard in a court of first instance, and are appealing the other verdicts. We will continue to defend ourselves in court, backed by the strong scientific and regulatory consensus. However, we are also prepared to settle when it is in the company’s interest.",
