Pessimistic Scenario - Current Policies: No carbon price is projected, implying that current policies will not drive meaningful carbon regulation in this scenario.

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) requires us to declare the carbon footprint of our fertilizer products for tax purposes in the European Union in the coming years. In addition, Chilean green tax regulations impose a tax on stationary (fixed) sources such as boilers and/or turbines that, individually or as a whole, emit: • 100 or more metric tons per year of particulate matter (PM), • o 25,000 or more metric tons per year of carbon dioxide (CO2). The latter regulation requires us to pay a green tax on Coya Sur's nitrate produc-tion. To adapt to these changes, we have developed a methodology for measuring our carbon footprint more accurately and then implement technologies to reduce emissions. Complying with these regulations not only helps us avoid penalties, but also strengthens our competitiveness in the fertilizer industry.
