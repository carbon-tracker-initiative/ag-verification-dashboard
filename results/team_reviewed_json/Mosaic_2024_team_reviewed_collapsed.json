Implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level. Through these heightened actions by the states, some are also leveraging groundwater protection initiatives to mandate nutrient use restrictions for fall applications in specific agricultural regions to limit nutrient losses.

The strategy calls for, among other matters, reduction of the flow of excess nutrients into the Gulf of America through state nutrient reduction frameworks, new nutrient reduction approaches and reduction of agricultural and urban sources of excess nutrients. Implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level. Through these heightened actions by the states, some are also leveraging groundwater protection initiatives to mandate nutrient use restrictions for fall applications in specific agricultural regions to limit nutrient losses.
