ICL is careful to ensure that the chemical substances it produces and sells are handled in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations throughout their life cycle. ICL prepares documentation containing information about products and provides proper guidance to its employees, contractors, customers and the public on the safe use of its chemicals and products. ICL implements the European regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) at all its operations and registers its chemicals as required by law. ICL has submitted registration applications for all the chemicals relevant for its businesses in the EU (production and sale). Several substances are under evaluation by the authorities (European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and Member State regulators), some of which have been listed as Substances of Very High Concern. ICL has volunteered to lead and prepare joint dossiers for dozens of substances (acting as a Lead Registrant). ICL utilizes data from toxicology, environmental fate, environmental toxicity studies and other relevant sources to classify chemicals and products according to the UN Global Harmonization System (GHS), a globally adopted classification and labeling system. All of ICL’s relevant chemicals are classified in line with respective classification and labeling regulations. All (100%) of ICL products undergo hazard assessments and regulatory screening. ICL performs detailed identification of all products and their constituents. As part of our Safety Data Sheets (SDS) procedure as well as the SDS creation process, the entire composition of a product is identified, reviewed, and assessed for hazards. This periodic assessment applies to all existing as well as new products and those under development. ICL monitors all regulatory requirements in regard to respective chemical laws globally to comply in all countries in which ICL operates (in addition to REACH), such as TSCA regulations and requirements in the US or specific registration requirements in South Korea. ICL provides its customers with SDS’ for all relevant products which are available in dozens of languages and beyond compliance requirements for most countries. Moreover, we provide tailored safety training and resources to our employees and other stakeholders who are logistics personnel and distributors, emphasizing the critical importance of safe handling practices for hazardous substances. The SDS lists regulatory information about each product and is periodically updated to remain in compliance with regulatory developments. In addition, product-specific regulatory information about registration/notification status is communicated to our relevant business segments and to our customers on a regular basis and upon request.In addition to REACH and the various chemical- specific limitations, the European Commission has introduced the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS). CSS was launched in October 2020 to provide a new long-term strategy for chemical-related policies, in line with the aims of the EU Green Deal. We are carefully monitoring developments related to CSS to prepare for upcoming regulatory requirements which may affect many of our products. We disclose all regulatory registrations and uses of our substances with the recognition that some uses by our customers may not always be fully known to us. This includes both product and chemical registrations, with uses defined either by us or our clients, and publicly available as required for example by REACH and biocidal registrations under BPR.",

It draws upon comprehensive physical, chemical, toxicological, and environmental data generated by ICL’s scientific group. Quantitative values like Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) or Derived No-Effect Levels (DNELs) are established based on toxicological insights, aiming to prevent overexposure to hazardous chemicals for both employees and the public. These values have been established to prevent employees and the general public from overexposure to hazardous chemicals. Specifically, regulations of food additives are based on positive lists of proven safe substances. If a substance is not provided for, it cannot be used in food. Adherence to food regulations involves rigorous scrutiny, ensuring that substances meet positive lists of proven safe materials. ICL has responded to evolving regulations, such as the 2019 prohibition of aluminum-based additives in certain food categories. Consequently, we have reviewed product specifications, modifying indications for use to align with regulatory standards. Furthermore, ongoing studies are conducted to identify and mitigate risks associated with substances, demonstrating our commitment to regulatory compliance and proactive risk management. This includes discontinuation of certain products or restricting their use to specific applications. For example, DECA has been discontinued, and methyl bromide is produced on a limited scale, solely for container disinfection rather than as a soil treatment. As methyl bromide (used for soil fumigation) has been included in the list of controlled substances, ICL has significantly reduced its production (for soil fumigation applications) and has shut down one of its production facilities.",

Such studies and tests are conducted only when no alternative in vitro testing methods are available, and in certified laboratories which are subject to certain industry and regulatory accepted guidelines (as the OECD guidelines), ensuring the welfare of the animals as per any applicable legal requirements. Due to increasing global awareness of animal welfare, the use of animals has been limited, at least for purposes of product development and licensing. As a result, methods are constantly being developed around the world, including the use of computerized models for prediction, as well as experimental models in tissue cultures. Some of these models are even accepted by authorities as substitutes for studies on animals. Over the years, ICL has worked to identify the most reliable and appropriate models that can provide data on the properties of substances under development. These models have replaced some animal testing, at least in the initial stages of product development. To date, we have succeeded in identifying alternative methods relating to several properties, such as the immediate toxicity of substances and skin and eye irritations.

By repurposing this industrial by-product, it reduces land use for long-term storage, mitigates risks of soil and water pollution, and improves the surrounding ecological environment.
