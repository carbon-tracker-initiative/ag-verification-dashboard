The plaintiffs are primarily public water systems that allege contamination of drinking water with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and seek to recover costs for investigation, monitoring and remediation. In 2024, BASF reached a class settlement with public water systems in the United States. The settlement, which does not constitute any admission of liability, provides for a payment of $316.5 million (equivalent to €301 million) to resolve current and future claims related to AFFF. The settlement was approved by the court in 2024. The payment was made in 2024. BASF has recognized a provision for this amount. In addition, BASF is a defendant in other AFFF-related lawsuits, including personal injury claims, property damage claims and claims by states and other governmental entities. BASF is also involved in other legal proceedings and investigations, including environmental, antitrust, product liability and patent infringement matters. The outcome of these proceedings and investigations is subject to considerable uncertainty. Provisions are recognized for all identifiable risks from legal proceedings and investigations if, based on the best estimate, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.",
