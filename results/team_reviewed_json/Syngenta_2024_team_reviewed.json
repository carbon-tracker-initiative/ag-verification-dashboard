Plaintiffs allege that their use or exposure to Syngenta’s paraquat products has caused them to develop Parkinson’s disease and/or kidney disease. The cases name Syngenta AG, Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC, and Syngenta Seeds, and variously named alleged distributors of paraquat as additional defendants. While the counts raised in each complaint differ slightly by plaintiff and jurisdiction, they tend to include: (1) Strict Liability - Design Defect; (2) Strict Liability - Failure to Warn; (3) Negligence; (4) Public Nuisance; (5) Violation of Consumer Fraud & Deceptive Business Practices Acts; (6) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability; and (7) Punitive Damages. Certain suits also include claims by the spouses of individuals with Parkinson’s disease for Loss of Consortium. The pending state court cases are in California, Delaware, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia. The pending federal court cases were filed in various U.S. District Courts, though the majority of new cases are being filed directly in the Southern District of Illinois as part of the pending Multi-District Litigation. On April 17, 2024, the MDL court granted Defendants’ Motion to Exclude the expert testimony of the sole expert on the critical issue of general causation that had been presented by the Plaintiffs in the four initial bellwether cases selected for trial. On the same date, the MDL court also granted Defendants’ Joint Motion for Summary Judgment dismissing those four cases due to the Plaintiffs’ inability to establish a causal link between occupational paraquat exposure and Parkinson’s disease without the proffered expert testimony. Plaintiffs have since filed a notice of appeal of these dismissals to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals; briefing was completed on October 16, 2024 and oral argument was held on February 12, 2025 and a decision is expected in the coming months. Syngenta will continue to defend all these lawsuits, the claims in which are without merit.",

Remediation of environmental damage at sites with which Syngenta is associated typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin. The assumptions used by Syngenta to estimate its environmental provisions may change significantly before or during the remediation period due to changes in the extent of remediation required or the method used to remediate the damage. In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available. The major uncertainties that impact the outcome of remediation are: the extent of the contaminated land area, which is not always limited to land occupied by the Syngenta site. Ongoing monitoring or remediation work may identify changes in the area believed to be contaminated; the nature of the work Syngenta will be obliged to perform or pay for. This depends upon the current or proposed use of contaminated land, substantively enacted legislation, and land zoning by and negotiation with the relevant regulatory authorities. In Switzerland, proposed remediation plans at certain sites may be subject to public referenda; sharing of costs with other past and present occupiers of Syngenta’s sites. At certain shared sites, Syngenta is responsible for an agreed proportion of remediation costs, which may change following discussions with authorities and the affected third parties. At other sites, third parties have agreed to reimburse Syngenta for some or all of the costs it incurs. Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating such long-term future obligations, Syngenta periodically supplements its internal expertise with external expertise when determining environmental provisions.",

Plaintiffs allege negligence through the sale by that manufacturer and by Syngenta of products containing such insecticides in the knowledge that they would be injurious to bees and by virtue of misrepresentations and concealment relating thereto.

Both of the additional causes of action are ancillary to and largely dependent on the negligence claim. The class has not yet been authorized.

The Quebec litigation closely resembles the original Ontario lawsuit claiming negligence except that, rather than a nationwide class, it alleges a class limited to Quebec. At this early stage damages are unspecified. The Motion for Authorization was argued in November 2017. The Quebec class has been authorized on August 20, 2018, and notices have been sent to potential class members. Plaintiffs’ motion to add Syngenta AG as a defendant has been granted. Syngenta will defend these lawsuits, the claims in which are without foundation.",
