While CF Fertilisers UK Limited does not sell solid urea fertilizer in the United Kingdom, limitations on fertilizer use have been and may be considered by other jurisdictions. In addition, Canada has announced a target of reducing emissions from fertilizers by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030 and is supporting implementation through improved nitrogen management and optimizing fertilizer use. These or other more stringent limitations on GHG emissions applicable to farmers, the end-users of our nitrogen fertilizers, could reduce the demand for our fertilizer products to the extent their use of our products increases farm-level emissions.

For example, the United Kingdom has implemented an assurance scheme beginning in 2024 to limit the use of unprotected or uninhibited urea products between January and March of every year. While CF Fertilisers UK Limited does not sell solid urea fertilizer in the United Kingdom, limitations on fertilizer use have been and may be considered by other jurisdictions. In addition, Canada has announced a target of reducing emissions from fertilizers by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030 and is supporting implementation through improved nitrogen management and optimizing fertilizer use. These or other more stringent limitations on GHG emissions applicable to farmers, the end-users of our nitrogen fertilizers, could reduce the demand for our fertilizer products to the extent their use of our products increases farm-level emissions. Any reduction in the demand for our nitrogen fertilizer products, including as a result of technological developments or limitations on the use and application of nitrogen fertilizers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",
