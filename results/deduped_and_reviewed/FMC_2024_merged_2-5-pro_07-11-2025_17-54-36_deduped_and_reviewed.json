This represents a 75% reduction from 2023 and is our strongest process safety record to date. We also enhanced FMC’s quality review and learning review protocols in 2024. The new quality review protocol strengthens process hazard analysis (PHA) by adding a critical layer of expert validation. Before a report is finalized, an expert conducts a review—validating findings, challenging assumptions, and uncovering opportunities for quality improvements. These reviews have led to improvements in PHA education, technical guidance, and execution standards, supporting a stronger, more consistent approach to hazard analysis. FMC’s new learning review protocol is aimed at driving understanding of root causes and standardizing corrective actions across all applicable sites to prevent incident recurrence. For example, we put the new learning program into action when a flexible connection failure between mechanical conveyors led to the release of hazardous powder.",

In 2024, our steady focus on process safety through hazard analysis and risk reduction efforts resulted in only one process safety event. This represents a 75% reduction from 2023 and is our strongest process safety record to date. We also enhanced FMC’s quality review and learning review protocols in 2024. The new quality review protocol strengthens process hazard analysis (PHA) by adding a critical layer of expert validation. Before a report is finalized, an expert conducts a review—validating findings, challenging assumptions, and uncovering opportunities for quality improvements. These reviews have led to improvements in PHA education, technical guidance, and execution standards, supporting a stronger, more consistent approach to hazard analysis. FMC’s new learning review protocol is aimed at driving understanding of root causes and standardizing corrective actions across all applicable sites to prevent incident recurrence. For example, we put the new learning program into action when a flexible connection failure between mechanical conveyors led to the release of hazardous powder.",
