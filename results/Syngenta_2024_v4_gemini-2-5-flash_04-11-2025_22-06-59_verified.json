      "summary": "The company does not explicitly disclose that agricultural crops developing resistance to its pesticides is a risk to the business. While the company discusses general market dynamics, competition, and the need for innovation in agriculture, it does not specifically identify pesticide resistance as a threat or challenge to its operations or financial performance. The 'Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements' and the 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' sections, which typically list such risks, do not mention this topic. The ESG report's materiality assessment identifies 'Agricultural technology' as a Tier 1 topic, but the associated disclosures focus on innovation and farmer challenges without linking pesticide resistance to a direct business risk for Syngenta."

The company explicitly states that its 'operations involve handling hazardous materials, operating complex machinery, and working in various environments, which inherently carry risks' and that robust management is needed 'to prevent accidents, injuries, and occupational illnesses'. Syngenta's HSE Code of Practice on Occupational Health and Hygiene specifically defines requirements for 'managing occupational health risks, including exposure to chemicals'. Furthermore, the company details its Process Safety Management for 'facilities handling highly hazardous chemicals'. Syngenta tracks and reports key quantitative indicators such as the Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), and Occupational Illness Rate (OIR), demonstrating active monitoring and management of these risks. While specific financial figures for these risks are not provided, the comprehensive identification of hazards, management approaches, and quantitative performance metrics clearly indicate that these are recognized and managed human health risks to the business."

The authorization motion was heard June 6, 2022, and a Quebec only class was authorized on July 27, 2022. In February 2023, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion to discontinue the Ontario proceeding to pursue the action in British Columbia.

This is evidenced by provisions for legal and product liability settlements, and detailed descriptions of major ongoing litigations. Specifically, the company faces thousands of lawsuits in the US alleging that its paraquat products caused Parkinson’s disease and/or kidney disease, with ongoing court proceedings and appeals. Additionally, similar class action lawsuits regarding paraquat and Parkinson's disease are ongoing in Canada. The company also faced several thousand lawsuits related to its Viptera corn seed, which have largely concluded. These disclosures highlight the financial and operational impact of such legal challenges."
