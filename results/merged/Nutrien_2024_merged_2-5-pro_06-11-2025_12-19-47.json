This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",

Legal matters with significant uncertainties include the following: – The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“US EPA”) has an ongoing enforcement initiative directed at the phosphate industry related to the scope of an exemption for mineral processing wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",

(“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",

          "text": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“US EPA”) has an ongoing enforcement initiative directed at the phosphate industry related to the scope of an exemption for mineral processing wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will not be material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations.",
