At the beginning of April 2025, the prices in the European market were at their lowest level in 12 months, reaching EUR 60/tonne, compared to EUR 78/tonne at the start of February this year. The reason for the price drop is the decline in the oil and natural gas markets, linked to the CO2 market. This may also be attributed to the anticipated lower demand for emission allowances in view of the deteriorating global economic outlook driven by the US tariffs, signals of shifting climate policy directions in Europe following the change in the US administration and, among other factors, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The Group companies proactively manage their purchases of CO2 emission allowances. Due to significant cyclical changes with resulting revisions to the companies’ production plans, including CO2 emissions, there is a strong need to adjust the volume of allowances to redeem the CO2 emissions for 2024. The companies are also selling their existing allowances repurchasing predefined volumes to secure additional financing for day-to-day operations. According to Refinitiv’s forecasts of 23 January 2025, the average price of CO₂ emission allowances is expected to be EUR 73.5 in 2025, down from EUR 76.9 in the previous forecast. Prices are projected to rise to EUR 91.9 in 2026 and exceed EUR 103 from 2027 onward. The emission allowance market remains a regulated market and the regulator’s intention is to achieve a sustainable increase in EUA prices in line with the growing climate ambitions of the Fit for 55 package. However, the economic downturn in 2025 in the euro area and the effects of high energy prices should stabilise the EUA prices in the medium term due to a decline in industrial demand.
