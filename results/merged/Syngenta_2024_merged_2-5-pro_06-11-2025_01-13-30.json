          "quote": "Canadian Litigation. Lawsuits alleging that Syngenta’s paraquat products have caused their Parkinson’s disease have been filed by plaintiffs seeking class certification in Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia. The Plaintiffs proceeded first in Quebec seeking to authorize a national class. Syngenta opposed the motion, and maintained that if authorized, the class should be limited to Quebec. The authorization motion was heard June 6, 2022, and a Quebec only class was authorized on July 27, 2022. In February 2023, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion to discontinue the Ontario proceeding to pursue the action in British Columbia. On August 9, 2024, the British Columbia Supreme Court issued a decision authorizing a Canadian class (excluding Quebec). Syngenta is appealing the decision, in part, related to claims certified in battery and of certain evidentiary admissibility issues.",
