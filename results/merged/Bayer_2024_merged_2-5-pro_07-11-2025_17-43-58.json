One group of pending cases with approximately 200 plaintiffs claims a wide variety of personal injuries allegedly due to PCBs in the building products of the school Sky Valley Education Center (“SVEC”) in King County, Washington. As of January 31, 2025, 10 trials had been completed in these matters, involving a total of 80 plaintiffs. 31 of these plaintiffs were not successful as the juries decided in favor of Monsanto or a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to reach a decision. The other 49 plaintiffs were awarded a total of approximately US$320 million in compensatory and a multiple thereof in punitive damages. ... In 2023, a putative class action lawsuit (Neddo) was filed in the District of Vermont by a mother on behalf of her three children who attended a local school. She alleges they are at increased risk of cancer from PCB exposure and seeks the cost of medical monitoring. ... We may incur considerable financial disadvantages from pending lawsuits and/or potential future cases if, for example, we are ordered to pay compensatory and possibly punitive damages or if we assume payment obligations under out-of-court settlements.",

Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto’s herbicides, including Roundup™-branded products. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma, and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiffs are claiming, inter alia, that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri. ... As of December 31, 2024, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled US$5.9 billion (€5.7 billion). Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with the products mentioned above. As of January 31, 2025, a total of 29 Canadian lawsuits (class actions and individual actions) relating to Roundup™ are pending against Bayer. The lead class action was partially certified and will proceed on the merits. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the safety of glyphosate and our glyphosate-based formulations vigorously.",
