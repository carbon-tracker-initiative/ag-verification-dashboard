The causes of action referred to in the lawsuit include negligence and negligent misrepresentations. The allegations include claims that Syngenta actively misled farmers about the importance of the Chinese market, the timing and substance of the application for approval in China, its ability to channel VIPTERA™ corn into non-Chinese markets and its ability to contain the infiltration of VIPTERA™ corn to the North American corn supply. The proposed representative plaintiff is seeking on behalf of the putative class general and special damages of 300 million Canadian dollars ($209 million at December 31, 2024, exchange rates), punitive and aggravated damages of 100 million Canadian dollars ($70 million at December 31, 2024, exchange rates), the costs of distributing all monies awarded to class members, pre-judgment interest, and costs on a substantial indemnity basis. Syngenta’s motion to strike this action was argued in April 2018, and on November 28, 2018, the judge dismissed the plaintiff’s action in its entirety. The plaintiff appealed this decision. The appeal was heard in June 2019 and while the Court of Appeal denied plaintiff’s appeal of the lower court’s decision dismissing the claim as to the negligent misrepresentation and Competition Act claims, it granted the appeal as to the premature commercialization claim which would allow the lawsuit to continue as to that claim alone. Syngenta filed the documents necessary to seek leave to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. On December 10, 2020, Syngenta’s application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied. The parties proceeded to the certification stage of the proceeding. The motion for certification was heard on May 10-12, 2021. On September 29, 2021, the Superior Court certified the lawsuit. The certification decision was procedural and made no determination on the merits of the case. On January 15, 2024, the parties argued Syngenta’s motion for summary judgment. That motion was denied on October 28, 2024 and Syngenta has filed a motion for leave to appeal. Syngenta is awaiting the court’s decision.",

Beginning in April 2019, plaintiffs in California state court filed complaints against Syngenta AG and Syngenta Crop Protection LLC and variously name Chevron USA, Inc., Growmark, Inc., and/or Wilbur-Ellis Company, LLC (or subsidiaries and/or affiliates thereof) as additional defendants. The ten California cases filed in 2019 have been consolidated for pretrial purposes. Defendants demurred to the complaints in the consolidated California cases on the grounds of federal preemption and primary jurisdiction. Defendants’ demurrer was denied by order dated December 23, 2019, except as to Count IV (the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act claim), which was dismissed, and on January 21, 2020, Syngenta filed its answers in the consolidated California cases. The settlement, discussed in further detail below, covers and conditionally settles the ten California state court claims that were pending. Additional cases were filed since the consolidation. On December 7, 2021, the Court entered an order coordinating the state court proceedings with the MDL. On March 15, 2022, the Court selected four bellwether plaintiffs from among the potential selections proposed by each side. Since bellwether selection, one plaintiff has passed away, and an additional bellwether plaintiff’s case was withdrawn after a medical exam concluded that they did not have Parkinson’s disease. The parties completed summary judgment and Sargon briefing. On November 26, 2024, the Court granted exclusion of the plaintiffs’ sole general causation expert under California law. The first state court trial was scheduled to begin on January 8, 2024, but that trial date has been adjourned. The case to be tried is still to be determined.",

The company details several ongoing and recently concluded major litigations, including: \n1. VIPTERA™ litigation: Multiple class action lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada alleging damages from product commercialization without Chinese import approval. While U.S. cases have largely settled (including a final settlement in May 2024), Canadian cases are ongoing, with one seeking 300 million Canadian dollars in general damages and 100 million Canadian dollars in punitive damages. \n2. Paraquat Parkinson’s disease litigation: Approximately 9,100 lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada alleging Parkinson’s disease and/or kidney disease from exposure to paraquat products, seeking damages. These cases are consolidated in Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the U.S., with ongoing discovery, motions, and scheduled trials in 2025 and 2026. Recent developments in 2024 include the exclusion of expert testimony and dismissal of some cases, with appeals ongoing. Canadian class actions are also proceeding, with Syngenta appealing a class authorization in British Columbia. \n\nSyngenta maintains product liability insurance to cover such claims and records provisions for legal and product liability settlements, although individual provisions are deemed immaterial. The company acknowledges that estimating liabilities for litigation is difficult and that 'additional costs may be incurred materially in excess of provisions recorded,' which 'could have a material effect on Syngenta’s consolidated operating results and cash flows.' Syngenta consistently states it is vigorously defending these lawsuits, believing the claims are without merit. The disclosures provide extensive qualitative and some quantitative (for VIPTERA™ Canada) information, clearly indicating that these legal challenges are a material and ongoing financial and regulatory risk."
