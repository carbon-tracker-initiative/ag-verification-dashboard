In August 2023, Syngenta and Cargill executed a settlement agreement regarding the Viptera litigation which Cargill had brought against Syngenta in Louisiana. As a result, Cargill’s claims against Syngenta regarding its AGRISURE VIPTERA® and DURACADE™ corn seed have been dismissed.

      "summary": "Syngenta provides extensive disclosure regarding class action lawsuits and legal challenges stemming from health and environmental claims related to its products. This includes detailed information on the Viptera corn seed litigation (product-related class actions with financial implications), the Canada beekeeper lawsuits (environmental claims alleging harm from insecticides with specific financial damages sought), and the Paraquat Parkinson’s disease litigation (health claims alleging disease from product exposure, involving thousands of lawsuits). The company also maintains 'provisions for legal and product liability settlements' for 'product liability claims' and 'tort claims relating to the release of chemicals into the environment', and explicitly states that it is 'reasonably possible' that expenditures could exceed these provisions. These disclosures collectively demonstrate that Syngenta views such lawsuits and claims as a significant business risk with material financial and operational implications."
