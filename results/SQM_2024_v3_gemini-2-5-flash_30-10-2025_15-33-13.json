The latter regulation requires us to pay a green tax on Coya Sur's nitrate produc-tion. To adapt to these changes, we have developed a methodology for measuring our carbon footprint more accurately and then implement technologies to reduce emissions. Complying with these regulations not only helps us avoid penalties, but also strengthens our competitiveness in the fertilizer industry.

Conservative scenario - Nationally Determined Contributions: Carbon prices are significantly lower, reaching only US$ 69/tCO2e in 2060, reflecting more moderate national commitments, similar to the current situation. Pessimistic Scenario - Current Policies: No carbon price is projected, implying that current policies will not drive meaningful carbon regulation in this scenario. Mitigation measures: As this risk could begin to impact in 2027, the first thing we did was to implement a methodology to quantify the CBAM footprint for the transitional reporting period between 2023 and 2025.

The fact that the company measures and reports these metrics indicates that energy consumption and its associated costs are a material business concern that is actively monitored. While it doesn't explicitly state 'risk,' the detailed tracking of intensity implies that managing these costs is important for business performance.",

      "summary": "The company explicitly discloses that high energy input costs are a risk to the business. It identifies 'Increased energy transition costs' as a 'Transition Risk' and, more broadly, 'Increased production costs due to greater costs of resources such as energy and/or water' as a 'Market Risk.' The company's decarbonization goals emphasize 'economically viable' solutions, further indicating an awareness of the financial implications of energy use. Additionally, the company tracks and reports 'Energy Intensity' metrics (GJ/t of Production and GJ/MUS$ of sales), demonstrating that energy consumption and its associated costs are a material business concern that is actively monitored. These disclosures collectively confirm that the company considers high energy input costs a risk to its business."
