## Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to the dashboard URL
3. The home page displays an overview of all analyzed companies

### Navigation Bar

At the top of every page, you'll find:
- **Home** - Returns to the main overview
- **Analytics** - Cross-company analytics and insights
- Links to individual company pages

## Understanding the Analysis System

### Classification System

Each disclosure snippet (a specific statement from a company document) is classified by completeness:

- **FULL_DISCLOSURE** (Green) - Complete, detailed disclosure that fully addresses the question
- **PARTIAL** (Yellow) - Some information provided, but incomplete or indirect
- **UNCLEAR** (Orange) - Ambiguous, vague, or difficult to assess
- **NO_DISCLOSURE** (Red) - No meaningful disclosure found

### Evidence Depth

**What it measures:** The number of supporting snippets found for each question.

- **Higher evidence depth** indicates more thorough documentation
- **Multiple snippets** per question shows comprehensive coverage
- **Zero snippets** indicates a disclosure gap

### Distribution Metrics

The dashboard tracks three key distribution metrics as percentages:

#### 1. Financial Transparency Rate

**What it measures:** Percentage of snippets containing explicit financial quantification.

- **Full Financial:** Specific amounts ("$50 million investment in sustainable agriculture")
- **Partial Financial:** Qualitative financial references ("significant investments")
- **Non-Financial:** No monetary detail ("we support sustainable practices")

**Higher financial transparency rate** = More quantified, specific disclosures

#### 2. Forward-Looking Rate

**What it measures:** Percentage of snippets with future-oriented timeframes.

- **Present day:** Current information ("In 2024, we are implementing...")
- **Forward-looking:** Future commitments ("We plan to reduce emissions by 2030")
- **Historical:** Past information ("In 2022, we reduced water use...")
- **Multiple/Unclear:** No clear timeframe or mixed references

**Higher forward-looking rate** = More future-oriented strategic disclosures

#### 3. Narrative Balance Rate

**What it measures:** Percentage of snippets presenting balanced perspectives.

- **Both:** Discusses both risks AND opportunities
- **Risk only:** Focuses solely on risks or challenges
- **Opportunity only:** Focuses solely on opportunities or benefits
- **Neutral:** Purely factual, no risk/opportunity framing

**Higher narrative balance rate** = More balanced, comprehensive risk communication

### Categorization Breakdown

Each snippet is categorized across three dimensions to provide analytical insights (not for scoring):

**Financial Type:**
- Full - Explicit monetary amounts
- Partial - Qualitative financial references
- Non-Financial - No financial information

**Timeframe:**
- Present day - Current operations and status
- Forward-looking - Future plans and commitments
- Historical - Past actions and results
- Multiple/Unclear - No clear temporal context

**Framing:**
- Both - Balanced risk and opportunity discussion
- Risk - Risk-focused narrative
- Opportunity - Opportunity-focused narrative
- Neutral - Factual statements without framing

- Higher financial transparency = more quantified disclosures
- Higher forward-looking rate = more future-oriented content

### 3. Question Rankings

**Top Performers:** Questions with highest average evidence depth across all companies
**Bottom Performers:** Questions with lowest average evidence depth

**What this tells you:**
- Which topics are well-documented industry-wide
- Which topics show consistent disclosure gaps
- Industry-wide disclosure patterns and priorities

## Interpreting Results

### What Makes High-Quality Disclosure?

**Excellent Disclosure:**
- Complete, detailed information (FULL_DISCLOSURE classification)
- Specific financial amounts ("$50 million investment")
- Current or forward-looking timeframe ("in 2024" or "by 2030")
- Balanced risk/opportunity perspective
- Multiple supporting snippets per question
- Clear, unambiguous language

**Good Disclosure:**
- Reasonable information provided (FULL or PARTIAL classification)
- Some financial specificity
- Generally current or forward-looking information
- Adequate evidence (2-3 snippets per question)

**Moderate Disclosure:**
- Partial information (PARTIAL classification)
- Limited financial detail
- Mix of timeframes
- Minimal evidence (1-2 snippets per question)

**Poor Disclosure:**
- Vague or unclear information (UNCLEAR classification)
- No financial quantification
- Unclear or historical timeframes only
- Very minimal evidence (0-1 snippets per question)

**Disclosure Gaps:**
- No meaningful disclosure found (NO_DISCLOSURE classification)
- Zero snippets for the question
- Clear area for improvement

### Red Flags

Watch for:
- **High NO_DISCLOSURE percentages** - Many missing answers
- **Low evidence depth** - Insufficient supporting documentation
- **Low financial transparency rate** - Vague, unquantified information
- **High historical focus** - Outdated information without current/future context
- **Unbalanced framing** - One-sided risk or opportunity focus

### Positive Indicators

Look for:
- **High FULL_DISCLOSURE rates** - Comprehensive reporting
- **Strong evidence depth** - Multiple supporting snippets per question
- **High financial transparency** - Specific, quantified data
- **Forward-looking content** - Strategic, future-oriented information
- **Balanced framing** - Risk and opportunity discussion

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What does "verified" mean?

A: Verified results have been reviewed and potentially corrected through a verification process. Original results are the initial analysis before verification. Verification may remove low-quality snippets or correct classifications.

### Q: Why do some questions have no snippets?

A: This indicates no disclosure was found for that question in the analyzed documents (NO_DISCLOSURE classification). This itself is meaningful - it shows a disclosure gap that could be addressed.

### Q: How are categories assigned?

A: Categories are predefined based on risk type:
- **Environmental Risk** (climate, water, biodiversity, waste, etc.)
- **Human Health Risk** (pesticides, food safety, product impacts, etc.)
- **Market/Business Risk** (market volatility, competition, supply chain, etc.)
- **Regulatory/Financial Risk** (compliance, litigation, regulatory changes, etc.)

### Q: What's the difference between classification and evidence depth?

A: **Classification** (Full/Partial/Unclear/None) is a qualitative assessment of how well a disclosure addresses the question. **Evidence depth** is the number of supporting snippets found. Both are important - you want both high-quality (FULL_DISCLOSURE) and sufficient quantity (multiple snippets).

### Q: Can I export the data?

A: Yes! Use the Excel export feature with `npm run export:excel` to generate comprehensive reports with all metrics and raw data. See the Excel Export Guide for details.

### Q: Why does disclosure quality vary within a company?

A: Different questions address different topics. A company may excel at disclosing some risks (e.g., environmental) while underperforming on others (e.g., regulatory). Question-level and category-level metrics show this variation.

### Q: What does "Multiple or Unclear" timeframe mean?

A: The disclosure mentions multiple time periods without clarity, or provides no temporal context. This makes it difficult to assess the current relevance of the information.

### Q: How should I interpret distribution rates?

A: Distribution rates show the *percentage* of snippets with certain characteristics:
- **Financial Transparency Rate**: % of snippets with financial quantification
- **Forward-Looking Rate**: % of snippets with future timeframes
- **Narrative Balance Rate**: % of snippets with balanced risk/opportunity framing

Higher percentages indicate better quality across these dimensions.
